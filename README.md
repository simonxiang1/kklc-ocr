# KKLC OCR

A search site for the entries of KKLC, most notably including mnemonics. You can enter either multiple kanji, comma/space separated IDs (entry numbers), or search by keywords.

The source code for the transcription process lives here too - namely API calls to `gemini-flash-2.0` and some prompt engineering.
